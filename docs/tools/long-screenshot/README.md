# Long Screenshot

A single html page app, to merge multiple screenshots into a single long screenshot image.

On mobile, it's often we need screenshot of a long page.

The idea here is to take multiple screenshots of different parts of the long page, and then merge them with this app.

Those images will have some overlap. When user load them into this app:
- all images will be listed vertically and seamlessly, just look like a single long image.
- user can drag each image up and down manually to remove the overlap.
- user can re-order the images.
- once user finished above adjusting, user can download 1 single long screenshot image.

## Technical Requirements:

- Single html page, including css and javascript.
- Can use external CDN for static resources.
- The page can work completely in client browser, no server is needed.
