# Old iPad Dash

Simple HTML Dashboard for old iPad mini.

I have an old ipad mini 1, which is very slow and can not install any useful apps any more.
I would like to mount it to the wall horizontally, use it as a mini dashboard, and show some simple widgets via a remote webpage from it.

## Device Info

Name: iPad mini 1
OS: 9.3.5(13G36)
Screen: 1024 x 768 on 7.9 inch, 163 ppi
Browser: Safari (iOS 9.3.5)

Any web technologies used must be compatible with above device and browser.

## Clock

The first widget I would like to build is a digital clock, which:

- show current time in HH:MM:SS and 24h format
- auto refresh every second
- in dark theme, the digits should be very bright
- only use basic html/javascript/css technology and ensure it can work on old safari browser
- include all html/javascript/css in a single clock.html file
- the webapp itself could be served on a ubuntu linux server, and the ipad open it remotely
