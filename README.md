## Hugo

1. Download a theme into the same-named folder.
   Choose a theme from https://themes.gohugo.io/ or
   create your own with the "hugo new theme <THEMENAME>" command.
2. Perhaps you want to add some content. You can add single files
   with "hugo new <SECTIONNAME>/<FILENAME>.<FORMAT>".
3. Start the built-in live server via "hugo server".

hugo will watch files in:

- /static/*
- /content/*
- /data/*
- /i18n/*
- /layouts/*
- /themes/<theme>/*
- config.toml
